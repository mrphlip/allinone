// Homestar All-In-One

//
// A combination of several useful scripts for Homestar Runner cartoons:
//  Homestar-Fullon, a greasemonkey script for making H*R cartoons fullscreen.
//  Seek Bar, a bookmarklet that adds a progress bar to flash cartoons
//   (with modifications).
//  Previous/Next buttons for Strong Bad Emails, TGS, Marzipan's
//   Answering Machine, Biz Cas Fri, Puppet Jams and main pages.
//  An HRWiki link on all pages.
//  The ability, if you turn on the "fullscreen" option, to keep the actual
//   stage the same size (so you can see "outside the frame").
//  Turning everything upside-down, like on April Fools Day, 2006.
//  A plain-HTML navbar, to replace the Flash one. This is mostly for me
//   as the navbar doesn't work right on my computer (font problems).
//   It could also be useful for others, letting you middle-click the navbar
//   to open things in new tabs.
//  Loading subtitles from the wiki and displaying them beneath the toon.
// All of these can easily be turned on or off with the "Preferences" box
//  in the top left.
//

//  up to three bookmarklets from this site in any way you want.")

//  Originally it was just the Pause button and the seek bar,
//  I modified it to add a frame counter, frame step buttons and zoom buttons.
//  I also modified it so the Pause button automatically updates when the flash
//  movie pauses itself (eg at the end of the toon).
//
// Previous/Next buttons written by Phillip Bradbury, but inspired by
//  StrongBad Emails: Prev & Next from http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/1015
//
// HRWiki link also written by Phillip Bradbury, but inspired by an attempt
//  by Tom Preuss to do the same thing - except it did the translation from
//  URL to Wiki page name in the script, this does it at the HRWiki server
//  so that when a new toon comes out, the script doesn't need to be changed.

//
// WARNING: This script explicitly avoids use of one of Greasemonkey's security
//  features. THIS SCRIPT SHOULD NOT BE USED on ANY page where you do not trust
//  the page writer. Not that it would make sense to anyway, given it's rather
//  Homestar-specific. Your use of this script is stating that you trust
//  The Brothers Chaps to not insert malicious code into the Homestar Runner site,
//  and the HRWiki admins to not put any on the mirror.
//
// One of the security features of Greasemonkey, used to plug its holes in
//  previous versions, is Mozilla's XPCNativeWrapper, which is used to ensure
//  that you're calling the real functions of objects on the page, and not
//  weird and potentially hazardous ones written by the page designer. However
//  this also blocks functions like flashmovie.CurrentFrame() which are needed
//  by the seek bar. Thus to make the seek bar work, I needed to turn this off.
//

//
// This is a Greasemonkey user script.
//
// To install, you need Greasemonkey: http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/
// Then restart Firefox and revisit this script.

// To uninstall, go to Tools/Manage User Scripts,
